# Introduction

Hello friend or foe who entered this report! This is a first attemt on writting a report and I kinda feel like Bilbo Baggins writting about The Ring and his Unexpected Journey... My story may not have any action yet, but, I would be really interested on creating a fellowship and exchange knowlegde, thoughts, goods and ideas for the future of Middle Earth... 

# Summary
Technically, it's not that hard for a task and I'll explain why... 

# 1st Deliverable
<h3>Step 1:</h3>
<h3>I didn't separate the deliverable into tasks or steps intentionally, so I would be free to experiment on the proccess of the code... I have many more stuff to try even after this semester is over!</h3>
<h3>It's easy, you basically follow the links on the description and search on Google for the 1st deliverable! So I started studying from <a href="https://glitch.com/~aframe-school-position"> A-Frame School</a> to build the different shapes! </h3>
<h3>Afrer this one is done, all I had left to do was to play with my code so I could change the colour of the shapes, the size the position and the rotation, although the rotation wasn't necessary for the sphere and the cylinder! Then, I studied the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/"> NPM </a> to finally find the commands for the snow in <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/aframe-speech-command-component"> A-Frame Speech Command Component</a></h3> 
<h3>Also, I didn't like the fact that my code was so messy, so I rearrenged it all by myself without using more code or another programm, because I was bored at that time and I had nothing more to do!</h3>
<h3>To conclude, I really enjoyed the proccess and I am really interested on searching deeper into the Augmented-Reality and coding. It's really easy if you follow a few steps and be positive through the whole proccess!</h3>
