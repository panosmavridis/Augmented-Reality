# Introduction

Hello friend or foe who entered this report! This is a first attemt on writting a report and I kinda feel like Bilbo Baggins writting about The Ring and his Unexpected Journey... My story may not have any action yet, but, I would be really interested on creating a fellowship and exchange knowlegde, thoughts, goods and ideas for the future of Middle Earth... 

# Summary
Technically, it's not that hard for a task and I'll explain why... 

# 1st Deliverable
<h3>Step 1:</h3>
<h3>I didn't separate the deliverable into tasks or steps intentionally, so I would be free to experiment on the proccess of the code... I have many more stuff to try even after this semester is over!</h3>
<h3>It's easy, you basically follow the links on the description and search on Google for the 1st deliverable! So I started studying from <a href="https://glitch.com/~aframe-school-position"> A-Frame School</a> to build the different shapes! </h3>
<h3>Afrer this one is done, all I had left to do was to play with my code so I could change the colour of the shapes, the size the position and the rotation, although the rotation wasn't necessary for the sphere and the cylinder! Then, I studied the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/"> NPM </a> to finally find the commands for the snow in <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/aframe-speech-command-component"> A-Frame Speech Command Component</a></h3> 
<h3>Also, I didn't like the fact that my code was so messy, so I rearrenged it all by myself without using more code or another programm, because I was bored at that time and I had nothing more to do!</h3>
<h3>To conclude, I really enjoyed the proccess and I am really interested on searching deeper into the Augmented-Reality and coding. It's really easy if you follow a few steps and be positive through the whole proccess!</h3>
    
# 2nd Deliverable
Well, the 2nd deliverable was way more trickier than I imagine. I put on many hours on searching how I will even start the project... The deliverable was separated on three tasks.

First of all, I had to create a custom marker that contained my dpsd number and furthermore the H and O atoms, which I did. I went to <a href="[https://www.npmjs.com/package/aframe-speech-command-component](https://ar-js-org.github.io/AR.js/three.js/examples/marker-training/examples/generator.html)"> AR.js Marker Training</a> and I did all the proccess required to make the markers.

For the 2nd task, we had to make 3D animations of the Hydrogen and Oxygen atoms, that were read by the custom markers that I had made earlier. I used the blender 3D program to make the 3d object and at the same time, I animated it. Afterwards, I saved the animation as an mp4 and I uploaded both the .gltf and .mp4 in my assets.

The final task was displayind a 3D animation of a water molecule as soon as 3 markers get in close proximity. It worked a couple of times, but after a while I stopped getting a display of the water... I really am not sure why it's not working and saddly, I don't have the time to restore any possible mistake.
